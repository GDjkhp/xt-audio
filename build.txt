Building XT-Audio

* Windows dependencies: asmjit (source), steinberg asio sdk (source), msvcrt
* Linux dependencies: libasound-dev, libjack-jackd2-dev, libpulse-dev, libpulse-simple

* Have a windows box or vm ready with:
** mvn on PATH
** cmake on PATH
** msbuild on PATH
** doxygen on PATH
** java sdk on PATH
** corflags on PATH
** asmjit (library source)
** asiosdk (library source)
** sandcastle helpfile builder
** visual studio 2019 or equivalent windows sdk

* Have an x86 and x64 linux box or vm ready with:
** gcc
** cmake
** alsa development libraries
** jack development libraries
** pulseaudio development libraries

* All machines should be able to access the xt-audio directory.
* On windows (preferably msbuild command prompt):
cd build && build.bat path/to/asiosdk path/to/asmjit (note the forward slashes).
* On x86 linux:
cd build && export XT_ARCH=x86 && ./build.sh
* On x64 linux:
cd build && export XT_ARCH=x64 && ./build.sh

Running the build will produce 3 folders:
* Scratch: working directory with all project files and binaries produced by individual targets
* Temp: complete outputs including required binaries for all projects, including debug builds and test programs
* Dist: only stuff that's actually supported ends up here: release versions of core library, wrapper libraries, sample programs, cli gui app and docs.

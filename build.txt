Building XT-Audio

* Windows dependencies: msvcrt
* Windows dependencies: asmjit (source, only when building with ASIO support)
* Windows dependencies: steinberg asio sdk (source, only when building with ASIO support)

* Linux dependencies: libasound-dev (only when building with ALSA support)
* Linux dependencies: libjack-jackd2-dev (only when building with JACK support)
* Linux dependencies: libpulse-dev, libpulse-simple (only when building with PulseAudio support)

* Have a windows box or vm ready with:
** mvn on PATH
** cmake on PATH
** msbuild on PATH
** doxygen on PATH
** java sdk on PATH
** corflags on PATH
** sandcastle helpfile builder
** asmjit (library source, optional)
** asiosdk (library source, optional)
** visual studio 2019 or equivalent windows sdk

* Have an x86 and x64 linux box or vm ready with:
** gcc
** cmake
** alsa development libraries (optional)
** jack development libraries (optional)
** pulseaudio development libraries (optional)

* All machines should be able to access the xt-audio directory.
* On windows (preferably msbuild command prompt):
cd build && build.bat [DISABLE_DSOUND] [DISABLE_WASAPI] [DISABLE_ASIO] path/to/asiosdk path/to/asmjit (note the forward slashes).
For example, to build with only DirectSound support: build.bat OFF ON ON (No need for asio and asmjit libraries in this case).
* On x86 linux:
cd build && export XT_ARCH=x86 && ./build.sh [DISABLE_PULSE] [DISABLE_ALSA] [DISABLE_JACK]
For example, to build with only ALSA support: ./build.sh ON OFF ON (No need for pulse and jack libraries in this case).
* On x64 linux:
cd build && export XT_ARCH=x64 && ./build.sh

Running the build will produce 3 folders:
* Scratch: working directory with all project files and binaries produced by individual targets.
* Temp: complete outputs including required binaries for all projects, including debug builds and test programs.
* Dist: only stuff that's actually supported ends up here: release versions of core library, wrapper libraries, sample programs, cli gui app and docs.

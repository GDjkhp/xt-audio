* Figure out JACK support on Ubuntu 20.
* Have aggregate stream open the device.
* Query device info without opening the device.
* Better document service/list/device/stream lifetime (what needs to be alive when).
* Cleanup logging and unnecessary class members.
* Add overrides.
* IPlatform, IDeviceList
* Device & stream events in favor of logging

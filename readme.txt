TODO: interesting stuff about supported build/run configurations goes here:
netcore/mono support on x86 linux, selective backend compiles, framework/compiler versions etc.
Also something about asmjit and asiosdk versions and linux development libraries, and pulseaudio/jack conflicts.
Also about sdk.windowsdesktop (no netcore gui support on linux).
